# Medication Name Lookup

This is a simple web application that allows users to look up brand and generic names for a given medication. It uses the [RxNav API](https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/RxNormAPIs.html) from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2.  Enter the name of a medication in the input field.
3.  Click the "Search" button.
4.  The results will be displayed below in a card format.

## Code Structure

*   **`index.html`**: Contains the basic HTML structure of the application, including the input field, search button, and the container for the results.
*   **`style.css`**: Provides the styling for the application.
*   **`script.js`**: Contains all the client-side logic for fetching data from the RxNav API and displaying it.
